# Welcome to your organization's demo respository
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.

# HF-RLHF-Platform
Platform being developed at MIT in collaboration with HuggingFace. Aimed at improving performance of existing Large Language Models through real-time human feedback loop.
